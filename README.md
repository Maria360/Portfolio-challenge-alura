# Welcome to My Portfolio Website ðŸ’»

Hi there! This is my first challenge for the Alura Frontend Program.

In this repository, you'll find a portfolio website based on my own professional profile.

## Note ðŸŒ¸

Please be aware that there's a contact form at the end of the website, but it's still a work in progress. I'm actively working on it to make it functional.

## Contact ðŸ“¬

Thank you for visiting! If you have any comments or collaboration inquiries, feel free to reach out to me at isagomezrodriguez05@gmail.com.
